		there are 5 different options:
		1: find time
			to find time, we could use equation number 3 and convert it to: t = (V - Vo) / a
		2: find starting velocity
			to find starting velocity, we could use equation number 3 and convert it to: Vo = V - (a * t) 
		3: find distance
			to find distance, we could use equation number 5: d = Vo * t + ((a / 2) * t ^ 2)
		4: find ending velocity
			to find ending velocity, we could use equation number 3: V = Vo + at
		5: find acceleration
			to find acceleration, we could use equation number 3: a = (V - Vo) / t
